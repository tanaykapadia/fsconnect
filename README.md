# fsonnect
A simple social networking web application created by me as a part of my IB MYP personal project.
I have created this digital product as a method for my peers (as well as anyone else around the world) to interact with each other through this platform.
The website has been made independently by made on a local xampp server using PHP/MYSQLi. You can contact me for any sort of suggestions or feedback.
